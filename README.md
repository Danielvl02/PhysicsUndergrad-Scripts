# PhysicsUndergrad-Scripts

Hi!, this repository is meant to showcase the various coding projects I've used during my undergraduate studies at the University of Guanajuato for the Physics Major. 

Throughout my years of studying, I've developed several coding projects for solving various problems and automatizing calculations.
Some of the code showcased in this repository was used for my thesis on Diffusive Wave Spectroscopy and a project on cosmic particle detection. The rest has been either homework or code I've used for other school projects.

Table of contents for each coding program and its use:

Thank you for reading this small description of the repository.

Daniel.
