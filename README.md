# PhysicsUndergrad-Scripts

Hi!, this repository is meant to showcase the various coding projects i've used during my undergraduate studies at the University of Guanajuato for the Physics Major. 

Throughout my years of studying, I've developped some code that has been useful to solve various problems or to automatize some calculations.
Some of the code showcased in this repository was used for my thesis on Diffusive Wave Spectroscopy. The rest has been either homework, or code i've used for other school projects.

Table of contents for each coding program and its use:
---- YET TO COME-----


Thank you for reading this small description for the repository.

Daniel.
